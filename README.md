# Code-Portfolio

In the branches of this repository you will find highlights of my project work over the past 4 year of my Bachelor of Engineering Degree.
Each branch highlights a different project, includes the program files and system designs for those projects, and a brief description of the project along with their components.

This repository will continue to be updated over time and shared where appropriate.
The end goal is to have a functioning website that highlights each project in more detail with links to the appropriate branches within this repo.

If there are questions about the packaged projects, please reach out and I am happy to help.
